A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the model performance!_"

    "2. The golden rule states that the model should not know about test data during training. If this is violated, the model will \"know\" what to expect and score higher during the validation step. This results in inflated validation score which reduces the ability to generalize unseen data. It will be \"worse\" in a sense that it is not accurate representation of its performance in new data.\n",
